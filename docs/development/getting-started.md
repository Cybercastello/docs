Getting Started with NodeBB Development
=======================================

After you've gotten your NodeBB environment installed and configured on your local environment, install Grunt:

``` bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Now you can run NodeBB in development mode by:

``` bash
$ grunt
```

This will now watch individual file changes and re-compile the necessary assets and restart NodeBB automatically.
