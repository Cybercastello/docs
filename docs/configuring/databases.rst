Configuring Databases
=====================

NodeBB has a Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL) that allows one to write  drivers for their database of choice. Currently we have the following options:

.. toctree::
    :hidden:
    :maxdepth: 0

    MongoDB <databases/mongo>
    LevelDB <databases/level>

* Redis (default, see :doc:`installation guides <../installing/os>`)
* :doc:`Mongo <databases/mongo>`

.. note::

    If you would like to write your own database driver for NodeBB, please visit our `community forum <https://community.nodebb.org>`_ and we can point you in the right direction.
