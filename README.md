# NodeBB Documentation Portal

This repository houses the content and source code for the [documentation portal](//docs.nodebb.org).

## Contributing

The primary method of contributing is by [making a pull request](https://github.com/NodeBB/docs/pulls). You can either edit the source code directly in GitHub (which would automatically fork the repository into your own account), or by cloning a local copy and forking the repository manually.

Documentation is written in Markdown. While Markdown supports HTML, we encourage the _minimal use of HTML_ so as to ensure that all documentation is of similar style.

If there are insufficient articles or incorrect information, please [file a new issue](https://github.com/NodeBB/docs/issues/new) against this repository. It will help us ensure that content is kept up to date.

Periodically, the NodeBB documentation will be updated to reflect changes in this source code. At this time it is a manual process. If it's behind and you wish to notify us, please open an issue ðŸ˜‚

## Localisation

At this time we do not have plans to localise the NodeBB documentation.
