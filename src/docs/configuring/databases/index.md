Configuring Databases
=====================

NodeBB has a Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL) that allows one to write
drivers for their database of choice. Currently we have the following
options:

-   [Mongo](./mongo) (default, [see installation guides](../../installing/os))
-   [Redis](./redis)

> **Note**
>
> If you would like to write your own database driver for NodeBB, please
> visit our [community forum](https://community.nodebb.org) and we can
> point you in the right direction.
